                        "text": "Im excited to share that Im working on a new book about building applications with foundation models. AI Engineering builds upon Machine Learning Systems Design, but with a focus on large scale, ready made models. The book covers: - The new AI stack (e.g. how it differs from traditional ML engineering) - Different approaches to evaluate open-ended systems - Dataset engineering - Prompt engineering, RAG, agents - Finetuning - Compute infrastructure, including how to mitigate latency and cost AI Engineering is scheduled for late 2024. An early draft of the first 3 chapters are available on the O'Reilly platform: Ive learned a lot during the research and writing process for this book. I hope youll find the learnings useful. Feedback is much appreciated! #aiengineering #aiapplications #mlengineering",
