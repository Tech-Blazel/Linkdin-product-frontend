There is something different about him, smart, assured and ready to dive deep into almost any technical topic. To have this passion and energy for 3 decades is applaudable.\n\nPreviously I also had a chance to interact with Jeff Bezos and he had a similar personality. These gentleman have achieved so much, created great businesses, but their technical acumen and hunger remains unsatiated.",
