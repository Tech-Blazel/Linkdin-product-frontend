Your stakeholders will come to you and ask for a real-time, AI enhanced, VR dashboard. But they mean they want the data updated 2x a day or maybe they only look at the report once a week and at that moment the data should be as up-to-date as possible.

Most tutorials you can find online assume that the training data is given and the set of classes is fixed. This never happens in the real-world business scenario. In my tutorial, you will see how to make a classifier starting from nothing: no labeled data, no taxonomy, no clear idea of what the result will look like. You will find the tutorial here: Huge thanks to SwarmOne for providing me credits for training very large models, Colab couldn't train. Given that this one was particularly expensive and if you want to see such real-world tutorials coming, consider supporting me: Enjoy and leave comments with questions/suggestions.",
