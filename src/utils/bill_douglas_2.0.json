And while he makes it look nice and easy most people are SIMPLY NOT WILLING to do what it requires. He gets in before 5am every day. Always upbeat. Great team player with a great attitude. In 18 months hes made about 35,000 cold calls and set a ton of meetings. And this is his first closing. Do you think you could do this? And now his pipeline is starting to fill. Multiple exclusive tenant agreements, multiple listings and an eight figure deal in escrow. Bright future! Cheers to The Kid!",
