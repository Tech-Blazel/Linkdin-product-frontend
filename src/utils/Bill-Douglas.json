The sprawl and complexity of production environments is no place for the best engineers to sink their time.\n\nCleric is an AI teammate that can quickly and reliably diagnose issues in production environments, from critical downtimes to the long tail of issues in your backlog. It understands your processes, knows how to use your tools and APIs, reasons through novel situations it wasn\u2019t trained on, learns from each incident, and never sleeps.\n\nInvestigations that previously took days, now take minutes.\n\nWe\u2019ve raised a seed of $4.3m led by Zetta Venture Partners and a set of AI, infrastructure, and security angels and advisors. \n\nIf you\u2019d like to try Cleric out, or help us build it, reach out!\n\nJames Alcorn Jocelyn Goldfein Mark Gorenberg Zak K.
