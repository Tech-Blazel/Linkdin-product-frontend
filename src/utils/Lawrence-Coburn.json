                        "text": "So, let me ask a stupid question (my specialty): If our existing large language models (LLMs) have already soaked up most of the world's information, why are we trying to update them with synthetic information, which will likely dilute the accuracy and relevance of the actual information already in the LLM? Instead, shouldn't we teach organizations and individuals how to use RAG and Contextual Continuity techniques to massage these LLMs to yield more relevant and accurate responses? If LLMs have reached the law of diminishing returns (and maybe they should just be turned into a public utility for the benefit of all), then let's invest in the people skills and tools to get more value from these marvelous LLM creations.
