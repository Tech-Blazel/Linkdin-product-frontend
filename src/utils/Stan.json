Our new TAO method scales with compute to produce fast, high-quality models: Test-time Adaptive Optimization (TAO) only needs input examples of a task and can outperform supervised fine-tuning on thousands of human-labeled examples. It brings OSS models like Llama to the quality of expensive larger models, while keeping inference cost low. TAO's trained model quality also scales with compute spent during training, not with human labeling effort. However, unlike \"classic\" test-time compute models like o1 and R1, TAO's resulting models are always low inference cost.",

Instead, shouldn't we teach organizations and individuals how to use RAG and Contextual Continuity techniques to massage these LLMs to yield more relevant and accurate responses? If LLMs have reached the law of diminishing returns (and maybe they should just be turned into a public utility for the benefit of all), then let's invest in the people skills and tools to get more value from these marvelous LLM creations.
