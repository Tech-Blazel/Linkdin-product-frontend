Our new TAO method scales with compute to produce fast, high-quality models: Test-time Adaptive Optimization (TAO) only needs input examples of a task and can outperform supervised fine-tuning on thousands of human-labeled examples. It brings OSS models like Llama to the quality of expensive larger models, while keeping inference cost low. TAO's trained model quality also scales with compute spent during training, not with human labeling effort. However, unlike \"classic\" test-time compute models like o1 and R1, TAO's resulting models are always low inference cost. We essentially shift much of the cost of test-time compute to the tuning process, and give much of the same quality at inference without the cost. Key to TAO is a search and scoring process that leverages test-time compute only during training, and new RL methods and models from our team.",

                        "text": "Who owns data quality? Its a question as old as Oracle Version 3, and the answer varies depending on who you ask. - Some organizations like to spread the responsibility around to multiple team members, each responsible for a few pipelines. - Others prefer to concentrate the responsibility on a select few specialists who have a holistic view of the entire platform. - And then there are those who view data quality as a technical issue, while others see it as a business or process problem. But at the end of the day, the only thing that matters is that it gets done. Shane Murray and I have spoken to thousands of data leaders over the years to understand the most common ownership models for data quality, and how data teams can apply them at scale. From data engineering to data governance teams, our latest explores the pros and cons of each approach: (Meme inspired by Chad Sanderson)",
