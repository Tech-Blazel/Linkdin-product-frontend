I remember going through slides at Starbucks, equipped with a PowerPoint deck, a game plan for growth, and what I thought was a solid pitch. But there were, of course, challenges and uncertainties to address. More than just building a company, our team was trying to create a category. Some were calling us \"Friendster for business,\" but the concept of professional networking was more or less untested. Our pitch deck had a vision I believed in deeply\u2014enough to stake my career on it\u2014but that didn\u2019t make it easy. Knowing what I know now, what I would tell myself back in 2004, during that pivotal moment for me and for LinkedIn? What advice would I give younger Reid? What reassurances or warnings would I deliver? \n\nI\u2019ve created a new Reid AI\u201420 years younger\u2014to pitch the real, present-day me on the 2004 LinkedIn plan.\n\nTo clarify: What you are watching is an attempt to use the latest AI tools to replicate some of my younger self\u2019s curiosity and revisit an exciting moment for the company I co-founded\u2014which is also an interesting test of how this technology can be used more generally. When we created \u201cReid AI\u201d\u2014my present-day avatar\u2014a few months ago, we did so by training it on 20 years worth of books and interviews. We had a 4K video interview to train a video model, and we were able to use voice replication tools to replicate my voice.\n\nTo create Reid AI 2004, my team had to get creative. It\u2019s a custom GPT trained on knowledge up to 2004, including my own writing. Using Hedra, UNSHUT, and other tools, we relied largely on an image-to-video process that doesn\u2019t require any training video but can generate video from AI-generated images. \n\nOverall, hearing myself pitch LinkedIn to myself was a bit surreal. I remember that early entrepreneur. This conversation between past and future selves feels not only like a reflection on how much has changed, but also on what remains constant: The core values of trust, integrity, and community that were pivotal in some of the startup's earliest pitches remain at the heart of LinkedIn today. \n\nI believe I would still invest in that idea. But I'm also amazed by how much 2004 Reid is about to see the world and technology change.\u00a0 \n\nWhat do you think? What would you tell the younger you from a decade or two ago?",
