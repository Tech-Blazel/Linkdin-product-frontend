Sit next to them and say absolutely nothing. Force yourself to marinate in the failure of your product design. Every version 1 of any software will be absolutely destroyed by first interaction with users. You need to watch your new creation be absolutely misunderstood by users to reform version 1 into the one that actually works. There is only one path: figuring out where the sharp edges, the places people get caught, the assumptions you make as a builder that turn out to be wrong, and then relentlessly sanding it down so that anyone can use it. That is good design. That is the key to a good product. There is no shortcut for this. WATCH USERS AND CRINGE AND THEN FIX IT. SAND DOWN THE EDGES.",
