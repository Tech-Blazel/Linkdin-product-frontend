In 2012, I even wrote a blog post titled \"Hey Graduates: Forget Plastics - It's All About Machine Learning,\" encouraging young people to study this field. Today, I see things differently. We've scrapped that requirement because a PhD is no longer needed to build an AI-forward company. The technical playing field is being leveled. There are massive opportunities for fast-moving startups that can \"AI-ify\" industries with today's existing technology. Case in point: Nick Ornitz and Shannon Kay at Topline Pro. Neither had deep AI expertise. But they recognized they could use GPT-3 to rapidly create SEO-optimized websites for home service providers. Today, they're serving thousands of small businesses with a team of less than forty people. Or take Matt Mireles at TalkTastic. His background? A \"pseudo-technical\" founder who taught himself enough to be dangerous. Now he's orchestrating AI agents to deliver personalized, founder-level support at scale. He built his entire customer support workflow in just four hours. The reality is that AI technology has evolved from something you need to build to something you need to wield. It's moved from being a computer science problem to being a business model opportunity. This doesn't mean technical expertise isn't valuable. But what's more valuable today is: - The ability to identify hair-on-fire problems worth solving - The judgment to know which AI tools to deploy (and when) - The creativity to reimagine entire workflows and industries - The strategic chops to select what experiments to run and in what sequence In other words, it's never been more valuable to be a flexible, fast-moving generalist who can quickly learn new tools, adapt to changing circumstances, and connect dots across disciplines. We're still all in on AI at Flybridge. But now we're looking for what I call \"10x Founders\" -- entrepreneurs who can harness",

Let me break it down for the first-time founders out there chasing headlines and term sheets like its Coachella: Heres how it happens VCs get their money back first. You raise $20M? They get that $20M before anyone else sees a dime. Sometimes they want 2x back. Thats $40M off the top. In some deals, investors get their money back and still participate in the remaining proceeds like common shareholders. Basically, they double dip while you hold the empty bag. You raise too many rounds, your 50% becomes 5% becomes hey, what happened to my company? You raised at a $100M valuation, but your exit is $30M. That $30M barely covers your liquidation stack. Youre getting zero. VCs often control the board. If they want to sell and you dont? Tough. If they want to block a sale you do want? . Youre now the CEO of a funded company to give yourself a $10K raise. And if growth slows? Theyll tell you to while they protect their investment. So how do founders miss this Because nobody talks about this stuff on LinkedIn with: Just closed a $5M seed grateful and humbled blah blah Meanwhile, they signed a term sheet . Why? Because they needed more runway! Valuation? Great. Terms? Disaster. : Raising VC is a trade Not a trophy Youre trading control, terms, and upside And if you dont understand whats in the deal youre not the CEO youre the employee Need examples? . $330M raised, $1B+ valuation, sold for $15M $900M raised, zero return $50M+ raised, sold for < $10M $41M raised, shut down, founders walked away with nada Before you raise know the stack Understand the game ask yourself: What happens if we dont hit a billion? Because exits dont always mean freedom. Sometimes, theyre just - Founders: want to build something that lasts and still keeps you in control? ~~~ Follow Gerald Duran for daily startup and VC insightsplus the",

But when you open up those connectionsespecially to third partiesyoure also opening up risk. If youre a security leader, Id be asking: Where are these integrations hosted? Whos validating these integrations? What would be the impact of malicious user input? Whats in place to catch the cases before attackers do? Bug bounty programs and AI red teaming help you get ahead of that. @HackerOne is working with companies like Anthropic and Snap to pressure-test AI systems in the wild. Worth consideration as MCP gains traction.",
