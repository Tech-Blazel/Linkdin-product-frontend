Update: All because a $6M Chinese AI startup just achieved what Silicon Valley claimed was impossible. Heres why DeepSeek is rewriting the rules of AI : Chinas DeepSeek just built a reasoning AI model that rivals OpenAIs bestand did it for 1/1000th of the cost. OpenAIs GPT-4: $600M+ training cost DeepSeek: $6M total And DeepSeek R1 is open source. DeepSeek is not just cheaper to buildits also cheaper to run. OpenAI: $100+ per million tokens DeepSeek: <$4 per million tokens This isnt just a cost differenceits a paradigm shift. Silicon Valleys AI advantage? Its evaporating. Tech investors in panic mode Global attention shifts to Chinas AI dominance. What if we dont need that many GPUs or even electricity to build better Models! DeepSeek R1 is: 27x cheaper than OpenAIs models Open source and permissively licensed A model that fully discloses reasoning steps This isnt just competition. As Marc Andreesen said Its Sputnik for AI. The game is changingand fast. Whats your take on this AI revolution?

We found that individuals randomly assiged to use AI did as well as a team of two without AI. And AI-augmented teams produced more exceptional solutions. The teams using AI were happier as well. Even more interesting: AI broke down professional silos. R&D people with AI produced more commercial work and commercial people with AI had more technical solutions. The standard model of \"AI as productivity tool\" may be too limiting. Todays AI can function as a kind of teammate, offering better performance, expertise sharing, and even positive emotional experiences.
